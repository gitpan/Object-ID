v0.1.1  Thu May 20 14:17:23 PDT 2010
  Distribution Changes
  * Lowered the requirement on version.pm to 0.77 (what came with 5.10.1) at the
    request of Debian to make packaging easier. [rt.cpan.org 57650]


v0.1.0  Wed May  5 18:06:31 PDT 2010
  New Features
  * Now works back to 5.8.8

  Performance
  * 2x performance boost on the first call to object_id() for each object
    thanks to Hash::FieldHash.

  Bug Fixes
  * object_id() will work with threads, but object_uuid() will not.
    Will fix itself when Data::UUID fixes threads.
